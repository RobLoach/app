  <a href='http://hubdrop.org'>HubDrop.org</a> provides mirroring of <a href='http://hubdrop.org'>drupal.org</a> projects on <a href='http://github.com'>GitHub</a> as a free public service.
</p>
<p>
  Drupal.org's git hosting or issue tracking will not be able to move to GitHub anytime soon, so hubdrop will act as a bridge for developers who wish to leverage GitHub for their projects, yet stay connected with the drupal.org community.

<p>
  HubDrop itself is <a href='http://github.com/hubdrop'>fully open source</a> and hosted on GitHub, so anyone can fork and improve the code. Hubdrop code includes <a href='http://opsworks.com'>Chef recipes</a> and a <a href='http://vagrantup.com'>Vagrantfile</a>, making deployment and development easy.
</p>
<p>
  Plans for the future include allowing projects to move to GitHub as the primary repo, with mirroring or releases being sent back to drupal.org.
